Still, very drinkable as aperitif; didn't enjoy as accompaniment to tuna steak yesterday.   \n",

       "1510   Tasted blind. This had a lot of dark fruit and woodsy tones on the nose. Much like other QC's I've had the alcohol was noticeable on the nose which was distracting. The alcohol was more integrated on the palate, but the dark fruit mixed well with some red florals and mocha. QC has never really been my style - too big, too broad shouldered and this completely fit that bill. I actually guessed this wine blind as the 2001 QC, so it ranks up there with my calling of a double-blind 2001 d'Yquem! ...   \n",
       "1524                                                 Very good: Overly fruity, but saved by a great finish. Powerful fruit nose (ripe blackberry and black cherry) smooth and slightly tannic in the mouth with dominant black cherry fruit. A long finish with a mix of fruit, oak balanced with a perfect dose of tannins. The strong fruit made made it difficult to match with dinner, but it worked well with nuts, raisins and creamy cheese. Perhaps it could work as an aperitif, but its too fruity for my taste.   \n",

This wine was full of leathery notes and dry smoked fruit. Medium bodied. It was rather old world in style. This was the first time I had this wine and my guess would be that much of the fruit has faded into the more earthy nuances the wine currently shows. Silky tannins. Drink now. Probably at the end of its drinking window. 89 points.   \n",

       "4806   Fairly typical Pride Cabernet, although it seems to have mellowed a bit since the last tasting and, based on my note from over a year ago, I don't think this wine will have a super-long life. It is still an excellent example of a Foley wine, with telltale mocha and coffee upheld by a supporting cast of cassis and strawberry notes. I'm afraid the tannins might outlive the fruit on this one. Not saying I'd drink them up right away, but I'd guess it might not get a lot better over the next 3-5 ...   \n",

Compared to earlier btls, this one seems to be within its peak drinking window. Sweet, mature fruit on the nose with an attractive note of rich grass/hay. Good depth, balance, and complexity on the palate with a long finish. Also unusual in that the nose of this wine is a perfect predictor and dance partner to the palate.

Confusing as it shows characteristics that could be conducive to any of those.When first opening (vinturi to decanter) the some fruits on the nose were there but definitely muted.

Very expressive nose of mostly black fruits, licorice, a hint of green, eucalyptus and bitter chocolate.

Nose: a strong Cabernet fragrance of blackberries and dark fruiits with a slight \"Napa\" spice, that scent I always smell with good Napa Valley wines. Also a hint of tobacco.

       "8033      Decanted for 90 minutes. Color - deep purple with good viscosity (nice legs). Nose: quite complex to me: raw meat first, then dark berries, vanilla, spice, just enough oak.Taste: very good complex balance. Layers of flavors: berries and vanilla then peppers (vegetal) to coffee on a nice long finish. Soft tannins and good mouthfeel make this a very enjoyable approachable wine to accompany any london broil or big steak. Could be good with dark chocolate as well. I'm going back for a full case!   \n",

Flavors of red fruit and tobacco are a bit dull on the attack but build throughout.

       "9253    As usual, Columbia Crest Grand Estates delivers the goods. Very similar to this label's excellent 2007 in almost every aspect, and almost as good overall. Lots of berries and vanilla both on the nose and palate. A bit on the lighter side, but ends with polished tannins and a long, fruit-filled finish. As one would expect, this isn't exactly loaded with varietal character or complexity, but is nonetheless quite enjoyable and all you can ask from a mass-produced $8 bottle of wine.50+5+11+14+7=87   \n",

       "9423   For how powerful and utterly delicious this wine is on the palate, it starts off slowly. Visually, it's about 70% opaque. The nose only hints at what's to come - it actually smelled like a rather ordinary red wine to me. Some fruit, a little iron, a bit of earth. But on the palate, this wine is extraordinary. On the mid-palate in particular. It has a powerful mocha streak that I found stunningly attractive. Imagine an iced cafe mocha served in a pint glass with a streak of Hershey's syrup do...   \n",

Mostly chardonnay blend, steel tank fermented. Light with some heavy citrus notes (lemon maybe) and some tropical fruit. Not nearly crisp enough however to hit its mark as a light summer quaffer, and was not complex enough to be anything more. Not terrible, but I can think of a lot better ways to spend $14 on a white.   \n",

Cellar Tracker said that this stuff should have been drunk by 2009. So i figured this stuff was vinegar by now. Well I finally opened it last night to see what I had. The cork was so brittle it broke and I had to push the rest into the bottle. After I used my filter and diffuser to put it in a decanter, me and my friends took a sip. On my! ...   \n",

It wood notes blew off eventually, but the slight hint of tropical fruit seemed scared to show itself for fear of bring back the oak goddess. On the palate, the goddess held an even tighter reign with the only fruit that dared show itself was tart bordering on sour. Eventually some caramel would make itself known but again the oak rules and has outlasted anything else going on here. Texturally it is pretty lush bu...   \n",

       "16919  This was an interesting one. On opening the wine was spritzy, and vegetal and a bit sulphurous. A bit better after a couple of hours but dramatically better 24hrs later. Then the vegetal/sulphur had gone completely. It had good citrus flavours, acidity and minerality. Still very primary indeed though. I can only speculate that the SO2 levels were quite high to ensure it didn't oxidise. It certainly seems to be needing quite some more time. I'll try again in a couple of years I think!

Very refreshing on a very hot day. Drank two glasses put the rest inthe fridge for TWO days. Showed terrific minerality after the two day rest. The wine clearly evoles with air and if you open it and plan to drink at one sitting, your tastes will dictate if you want to ice it down or let it open as it warms. Nice bottle   \n",

They don't age into a highly complex style, but they stay quite enjoyable and have a lot of crowd-pleasing appeal. Having said that, while there is no huge hurry, I think the smart thing would be to drink up your remaining bottles in the coming year or so.   \n",

Wonderful flavors of juicy black fruits supported by tobacco/espresso. Very well-integrated oak. Impeccably balanced, great nuance and complexity, and a very soft, lush mouthfeel.

Touch of mintish herb or oak shows up at times. I could imagine this was plush years ago, but it's shed any baby fat that may have existed and now is deep with dark flavors and a pretty long finish. Not extremely complex, but good mix of dark fruits with occasional oak tinges. While big, not at all jammy or fruit bomby.   \n",

Didn't think I'd need to air out a '97 Merlot. Wrong I was. Considerably more attractive after some time in the decanter. Recommend 60-90 minutes. Very elegant nose, with a palate that gains weight and dignity with some air. Its balance is profoundly impacted, in a positive way, with a bit of patience. Drinking well now, with the aforementioned caveats.   \n",

We tasted it over a period of 1 1/2 to 2 hours. The initial pour had a small amount of heat to it. But after the 1st sip or 2 the alchol began to integrate nicley with the velvety layers of fruit, spice and chocolate and provided a nice long finish.

       "22887  Better this time; intentionally kept the decant shorter, only 1.5 hours. The additional couple weeks in the cellar also could have helped it settle after receiving from Garagiste. The nose was similar, with hints of dark fruits, nice ageing characteristics like kirsch, and light tar and cedar. The palate was more green this time, but very round still. The finish took on the tar notes as the wine oxidized in the decanter. Overall, very smooth and pleasing. Elegant with great aged characterist...   \n",

       "24724  This was the most odd bottle of wine I've ever had. Opened on a Saturday night with friends and we all would've bet money it was a bad bottle. Not corked, but simply dead. No fruit whatsoever, nose was musty and it tasted like bitter, dry dirt. Recorked with the intent to dump at the end of the night but due to laziness, it was left on the counter until Tuesday. Out of sheer curiosity I tried a sip and was stunned by how it transformed into a very respectable bottle. The tannins have softene...   \n",

Tobacco, raspberry, herbal. On palate, fulll bodied with more of a dried fruit (cranberry / red currants) profile - very structured with medium+ finish and nice drying tannins. This was a very nice bottle of wine - given there was no degradation on night 2 I'd decant for 4-5 hours if drinking now. 91+   \n",

Medium fruity nose. Amazingly primary on the palate, medium to full bodied, showing vibrant tart redtoned cherrylike fruit. Vibrant and firm tannic grip and acidity. Quite robust and fruity, without showing significant signs of ageing.Difficult to say where this is heading, but can certainly hold for 10 more years.   \n",

On the nose, sweet dark cherry/blueberry, dark chocolate, and hints of tobacco and sweet vanilla. Up front, dense lush blueberry/blackberry flavors, balanced with just the right amount of acidity. Nice soft, lush tannins on a long finish with hints of chocolate and black licorice. A very pleasant experience and will buy again for my cellar.   \n",

Didn't know what to expect. But what I got was a medium bodied red showing great red fruited aromatics. The palate was soft, but still balanced, and it's just delicious right now. I think I always sell L'Ecole short for some reason. I would imagine that this wine is at its peak right now.   \n",

The palate was just as impressive completely filling the mid palate with fruit extract. Full bodied, in balance despite a very high alcohol, tannins are dusty and ripe. This was a return to formr glory for this wine. I chose this as my 3rd place finisher and corectly guessed the identity. I also expected women to like it better.   \n",

I wonder whether it is somewhat past its prime, but since I only had one bottle of this vintage I have no basis for knowing.   \n",
       "29448  Similar to notes from a year ago. Didn't get much off the nose given the heavy use of garlic in the kitchen and the fall leaves smell out on the deck, so no opinion there. On the palate, this bottle initially leans a bit more towards \"meaty\" than did the prior bottle. With a bit of time, a much needed brightness comes out on the palate in the form of menthol and cedar. Remains slightly tannic on the finish. IMO, needs a brief decant to let the meat funk blow off, and allow its true character...   \n",

Definitely very nice on the nose and palate -- coffee, leather, earthiness, with some blackberry notes. The drawback here is that flavors are somewhat dilute. NB: took about 60 to 90 minutes to open up properly. Update: after a night open in the fridge, showed very fragrant and feminine with additional floral notes on the finish. This is more 'Burgundy' than 'Bordeaux'.   \n",

Palate: More fuller bodied than past experience that coats your tongue rather than refreshes it. Ample acidity from the pineapple notes and grapefruit finish.

It had an amazing nose, with a kaleidescope of aromatic scents, from white flowers and lavender, to ripe stone-fruit in the peach and nectarine spectrum, notes of pink guava juice and then some mineral and earth at the edges of the bouquet.

The 13.9% abv was much more noticeable to me than it has ever been, and the acidity was low-moderate. Still like the flavor profile a lot - citrus, tropical fruit, and herbs. I'm going to start looking for the 2009 and I'll probably make an effort to drink it young.   \n",

With vivid minerals, and stone fruits set upon a firm but balanced core of acidity. This has a lingering finish with a hint of bitter almond. It left me wanting more (read: more wine AND more oysters). Give this a year in the bottle and watch it sing. Approximately $38. Drink thru 2013   \n",

Surprisingly fresh for its age, there is absolutely no sign of oxidation yet. Made in a bombastic oaky style that was popular 10 years ago and certainly is less in demand today.

Absolutely decadent minerality and viscosity on the palate with fruit that started subtle but picked up steam as the wine moved along the tongue. Kept getting better and better as the wine opened. Sad that this way only bottle a the wine should improve with another year or two of bottle age. Do NOT serve too cold.   \n",
       "37912                    Opened at a fairly cool tempature straight from the wine fridge. Lovely wine for a (subsequently determined) dinner of curry chicken, basmati rice and brocolli/cauliflower - initially apple with some plum/fig hints after opening up; citrus was less evident than other reviewers have noted, probably masked by lemon in my water and on the broccoli. Buttery testure is also of note in this wine - lots of soft fullness in the mouth with a long finish. Inventory shows one more; good.   \n",

I thought 14 years would do. It needs more time. I double decanted in the morning. At dinner at Prime 112, it was still austere, so we used the Vinturi aerator and it finally began to reveal itself.

The first impression is chocolate followed by a smooth cherry giving way to a hint of cranberry. I notice that 2006 FH Cab is well balanced with a little bit of tannin in the end eliciting some chewiness. This is yummy juice for the price that will average around $25.00 per bottle and comes from one of those small boutique vineyads in oakville.   \n",

Flavors similar, with cherry but almost pie-cherry fruit nicely mingled with cedar, light tar and black olive although those \"old-cab\" flavors still taste good because of that cherry fruit and great balance. I had the 1st glass blind and assumed it was a few years older and by the time we finished the bottle, as good as it was, I feel it's aging a tad faster than one might want so I think it's time to drink.   \n",

In the mouth flavors of blackberry transition to blueberry pie, bakers chocolate, mocha, and light cedar notes. At this point in time the finish is about 30 seconds long. It's powerful while still delicate...and that's what I really love about these Teachworth Cabs. More to follow after a 4 hour decant...I'm bringing this to a dinner tonight in my d...   \n",

Very sweet with new American Oak, and ripe cassis and dark fruits. At this early stage, I think I am going to prefer the 2001 over the 1997. It is curious if the fruit, tannins and oak will balance out over time, but right now it is a true OAK bomb!! Rated 91 currently withpotential rating of 93.   \n",

The nose is subdued after 2 hours, with mostly cocoa and mocha . The wine did devekp and the alcohol subsided after a few hours, but not a WOW type of wine.

On the palate, the wine displays blackberry liqueur, pepper and black cherry flavors and a long finish. This will age well.   \n",

Loved the fruit bomb of a nose but noticed that quickly disappeared for some alcohol and oak. On the palate up front red fruit led to complete oak dominance. Just way too much oak for my palate. Day 2 and 3 got even more oakey which I found odd. Pass on this.   \n",

The cherry fruit is nice on the palate, and the acidity works well as the cherry flavors run down the sides of my mouth. The oak is evident, and the tannins are actually on the lighter side. There's a bit of heat evident, and it's not very well integrated now. I expect this to improve significantly with a couple years in bottle.   \n",

       "1318   Deep ruby color. Nose was bursting with aromas of cherry and plum, along with pleasant hints of oak and vanilla. It was like standing in the underground caves of a winery, surrounded by countless oak barrells aging newly picked grapes. On the palate, the flavor of dark cherry was complimented by tobacco, earthiness, and sweet undertones. The finish was silky smooth, with a little chocolate. This full-bodied, complex Cab paired perfectly with our roasted tomato soup. Fine tannins; well-balanced.   \n",

       "1510   Tasted blind. This had a lot of dark fruit and woodsy tones on the nose. Much like other QC's I've had the alcohol was noticeable on the nose which was distracting. The alcohol was more integrated on the palate, but the dark fruit mixed well with some red florals and mocha. QC has never really been my style - too big, too broad shouldered and this completely fit that bill. I actually guessed this wine blind as the 2001 QC, so it ranks up there with my calling of a double-blind 2001 d'Yquem! ...   \n",

Powerful fruit nose (ripe blackberry and black cherry) smooth and slightly tannic in the mouth with dominant black cherry fruit. A long finish with a mix of fruit, oak balanced with a perfect dose of tannins. The strong fruit made made it difficult to match with dinner, but it worked well with nuts, raisins and creamy cheese.

This wine reminded me of violet candy, or red licorice, but with some seriously elegant plum notes, and some soft complexity. It almost felt like plum and lavender mixed into an elegant and complex wine. Drinking beautifully right now, but with many years left to go. It paired exceptionally well with the first course of quail and raspberries.   \n",

This wine was full of leathery notes and dry smoked fruit. Medium bodied. It was rather old world in style.

This bottle was begging to be opened. Had too much of the earthy finish for a medium bodied. It had mixed reviews however, I found it to have more complexity than expected. Decanted for four hours and the finish really defined itself. However, the plain berry flavor accompanied by a one dimensional nose kept this from scoring over a 90.   \n",

Color was rich with no bricking, and nose was unimpressive but not offensive either. Much of the early fruit power has tamed on this wine, and it has developed some smoothness and has dropped the annoying aftertaste acquired from the American oak used. Compared to the dismal performance of the '01 lately, this was a pleasant surprise. The better half enjoyed this quite a bit!   \n",

       "6225   Not good, but drinkable. A bit green, but oddly, not in a way that offends me.The more interesting thing about this wine is that it allowed me to experiment with different preservation methods:1) a 187ml bottle filled to the top and stored in the fridge for two weeks: lost something, but was still drinkable. tasted like a day 3 wine.2) a 375ml plastic bottle filled to the top and frozen for 2 weeks kept its flavor pretty well. defrosted sunday, did not drink til monday... can't say with prec...   \n",

Cherry is the predominate fruit going on, the oak is present but not overwhelming, tannins are soft (merlot influence), and the juice is rounded out and balanced quite nicely.

But it's hard to believe with a shaft of oak up your nose. It did go well with teriyaki marinated chicken sticks because of the sweet oak so I'll give it credit for that. Attractive in weird non-varietal way. Maybe the hint of botrytis throws it off.   \n",
       "10507                         This wine deserves the high scores it is receiving. Mellon, pineapple, and honeysuckle flavors with thick concentration and great mouthfeel and acidity. Almost sauvignon blanc-ish without the over the top citris. This isn't my preferred style of chardonnay, but I completely understand & appreciate what the winemaker set out to accomplish. Phenominal QPR. This will likely get the nod for our Thanksgiving wine as it is sure to be a crowd pleaser. Served with shrimp n grits.   \n",

       "16919  This was an interesting one. On opening the wine was spritzy, and vegetal and a bit sulphurous. A bit better after a couple of hours but dramatically better 24hrs later. Then the vegetal/sulphur had gone completely. It had good citrus flavours, acidity and minerality. Still very primary indeed though. I can only speculate that the SO2 levels were quite high to ensure it didn't oxidise. It certainly seems to be needing quite some more time. I'll try again in a couple of years I think!

       "20066                           I've had a couple of bottles of each of this and the 1998 in the last year or two, and for off-vintages of a wine whose style isn't supposed to age well, all have held up nicely and still have considerable fruit left. They don't age into a highly complex style, but they stay quite enjoyable and have a lot of crowd-pleasing appeal. Having said that, while there is no huge hurry, I think the smart thing would be to drink up your remaining bottles in the coming year or so.   \n",

       "22181  Drank beautifully last night with a steak dinner. Initial pour indicated a bit of berry on the palate. Really smoothed out after a half hour. Little berry, more cassis, lots of light earth notes to it and tinge of smoke. Interweaves through the palate for a seamless sip from the tip of the tonge through the mid and back palate and on to the very long finish. Did not time but found myself speaking and still tasting the finish. Absolutely no burn, very silky on the tongue. Not a magical intera...   \n",

       "22887  Better this time; intentionally kept the decant shorter, only 1.5 hours. The additional couple weeks in the cellar also could have helped it settle after receiving from Garagiste. The nose was similar, with hints of dark fruits, nice ageing characteristics like kirsch, and light tar and cedar. The palate was more green this time, but very round still. The finish took on the tar notes as the wine oxidized in the decanter. Overall, very smooth and pleasing. Elegant with great aged characterist...   \n",

No fruit whatsoever, nose was musty and it tasted like bitter, dry dirt. Recorked with the intent to dump at the end of the night but due to laziness, it was left on the counter until Tuesday. Out of sheer curiosity I tried a sip and was stunned by how it transformed into a very respectable bottle. The tannins have softene...   \n",

I was given this bottle after attending a public tasting a few years back (I did not try this wine at the tasting though), and I just had it tucked away with my odd-lots - I had no idea what to expect.

       "29448  Similar to notes from a year ago. Didn't get much off the nose given the heavy use of garlic in the kitchen and the fall leaves smell out on the deck, so no opinion there. On the palate, this bottle initially leans a bit more towards \"meaty\" than did the prior bottle. With a bit of time, a much needed brightness comes out on the palate in the form of menthol and cedar. Remains slightly tannic on the finish. IMO, needs a brief decant to let the meat funk blow off, and allow its true character...   \n",

Long finish, but with each click of the tongue the wood comes back. Nice, actually very nice... I just wish it was taken out of the barrell and put in the bottle earlier.   \n",

Wonderful aromas of baked apple, lemon, lime, minerals (saline, limestone, a touch of chalk), sweet ginger-like smoke. A tremendously nose for me. Same mouth flavors, with the addition of possibly some pear. Very nice fruit concentration and structure. Still has a velvety and lingering finish. Pairs quite nice with fried scallops.

The nose was rather full, with melons and tropical fruit and a slight buttery component. Oak? The palate was also very fruity, with some acidity, a bit of earth, white fruits and the oak seems to be there, although not very in the front, brings a nice roundness to the wine. Quite an ok wine, but nothing that really gets me going.   \n",

Despite, this was wine simply a superb example of how good oaked sav blanc truly can be in the US.

Lovely wine for a (subsequently determined) dinner of curry chicken, basmati rice and brocolli/cauliflower - initially apple with some plum/fig hints after opening up; citrus was less evident than other reviewers have noted, probably masked by lemon in my water and on the broccoli. Buttery testure is also of note in this wine - lots of soft fullness in the mouth with a long finish. Inventory shows one more; good.   \n",

Flavors include pear, ripe banana, a touch of lemon, noticeable minerality and a tart finish. Smooth creamy texture which I would have guessed came from oak.

Green bell peppers, lemon slice, and salty, stinky sea water adorned the lipstick smack nose. Had above average mouthfeel, smooth and sleek thanks to the French handling; middle ground acid but with plenty of tangy, salty lemon; lacked freshness, perhaps owing to some oxidation from the bad cork.

       "10507                           This wine deserves the high scores it is receiving. Mellon, pineapple, and honeysuckle flavors with thick concentration and great mouthfeel and acidity. Almost sauvignon blanc-ish without the over the top citris. This isn't my preferred style of chardonnay, but I completely understand & appreciate what the winemaker set out to accomplish. Phenominal QPR. This will likely get the nod for our Thanksgiving wine as it is sure to be a crowd pleaser. Served with shrimp n grits.\n",

A pale yellow-ish straw. The nose is subdued, but with marked butteriness and with a hint of grassiness. A big, rich attack. Very full and buttery on the palate: rich and fruit-driven.

A really nice food wine that everyone enjoyed and probably my favorite VA wine to date. 50+5+12+16+7\n",

Then the vegetal/sulphur had gone completely. It had good citrus flavours, acidity and minerality. Still very primary indeed though.
