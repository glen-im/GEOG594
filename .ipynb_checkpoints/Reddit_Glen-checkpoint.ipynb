Bob Lazar explained a certain intelligent beings Aircraft that could do such capabilities to travel through TIME and Space.\\n\\nTime travel seems like a very complicated procedure, to say the least. However, I do believe that we could one day encounter beings with such technology. \\n\\n> I have so many questions about why haven’t we tried to become intelligent beings and create such capable devices?\\nWhy are we so behind in intelligent knowledge?\\n\\nWe are a relatively very young species. I\\'d argue that we are definitely trying to create such capable devices, but they are being developed by the military in top secret remote locations. Obviously time travel is probably not within our grasps just yet, but imagine all of the top secret projects that the military/government is currently working on. \\n\\nWith that being said, humans have made some very impressive technological advancements in their short history, such as the internet, which allows us to communicate online from X amount of miles away. It\\'s actually extremely remarkable in many ways. I can\\'t say for sure, but I can imagine our government having the ability to reproduce Westworld-esque Artificial Intelligence/clones as I type this. \\n\\nFor all we know, clones could be walking our streets; clones that are indistinguishable from real human beings. \\n\\n> What made beings from other planets and start systems POSSESS so much intelligent KNOWLEDGE to build and use these AIR AND SPACE CRAFTS.\\n\\nPerhaps other alien beings, without having full knowledge of how their \"brains\" would work, are more mathematically inclinded. Maybe less empathy, love, emotions, and instead, more math, science, logic, calculating, etc. Plus they would probably be much older than humans, thus having more time for their brains to develop. Maybe they have expanded beyond \"brains\" and have connected their minds to some kind of Cloud-system that allows them to acquire much more knowledge. I\\'m not entirely sure how that would work though, but I do see that coming in the future for us as a species. \"Homo-digitalis\" as I\\'ve seen it dubbed. \\n\\nI\\'m just rambling at this point.

The story goes that the Creek waited until the light of the full moon became even too bright for the nocturnal cave-dwellers to face, ambushed them in their weak moment and drove them from their homeland into parts unknown.\\n\\nAccording to a 16th-century manuscript published by Welsh antiquarian Humphrey Llwyd, a Welshman by the name of Prince Madoc was believed to have sailed from Wales across the Atlantic to what is now Mobile Bay, Alabama in the year 1171.\\n\\nLegend has it that upon arriving, Madoc and his crew ventured north along the Alabama River toward the Tennessee Valley, and were never heard from again.

The troubling revelation comes as Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has rejected a U.S. “humanitarian aid” convoy over concerns that it could contain weapons meant to arm the country’s U.S.-backed opposition.\\n\\nLast Tuesday, Venezuelan authorities announced that 19 rifles, 118 ammo magazines, 90 radios and six iPhones had been smuggled into the country via a U.S. plane that had originated in Miami. The authorities blamed the United States government for the illicit cargo, accusing it of seeking to arm U.S.-funded opposition groups in the country in order to topple the current Maduro-led government.\\n\\nA subsequent investigation into the plane responsible for the weapons caché conducted by McClatchyDC received very little media attention despite the fact that it uncovered information clearly showing that the plane responsible for the shipment had been making an unusually high number of trips to Venezuela and neighboring Colombia over the past few weeks.'},\n",

The Justice Dept. has the capacity to act extra-judicially but are going to great lengths not to when it comes to Trump. The only thing “psychopathic” going on is the irrational insistence that a vast litany of suspicious contacts, corrupt appointments, and blatant lies, fumbled coverups, and general illegality coming out of this administration doesn’t add up to something with investigating thoroughly. This behavior would warrant extreme concern regardless of who was in office. Those throwing up smoke to hamper this Republic’s legal immune system are a far larger issue outside the normal partisanship in DC.'},\n",

       "  'text': 'It is a witch hunt. Every single indictment has nothing to do with collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. If the witches you are attempting to find have nothing to do with the core of the *hunt* then you can’t then proclaim them to be witches. It is the definition of what a *witch hunt* actually is. \\n\\nThe FBI and intelligence community had imbedded spies in the Trump campaign prior to him even winning the Republican party nomination. The same individuals in the FBI who oversaw the Clinton email investigation were the same ones who started the Russia investigation. These individuals were caught via text messages attacking Trump and discussing ways to stop Trump from becoming President and talking about an “insurance policy” to make it happen. The FBI’s evidence of “Russian interference” via the hack of DNC servers wasn’t independently verified by the FBI—they took the findings of CrowdStrike, which was a private company paid for its findings by the DNC, at face value.\\n\\nThe company Fusion GPS was hired by the Clinton Campaign to gather dirt on Trump in the Spring of 2016. The head of Fusion GPS, Glenn Simpson, met with the same Russian lawyer of the infamous “Trump Tower meeting” the day *before* and the day *after* her meeting with Don Jr and others at Trump Tower. This is the same company which paid former British agent Christopher Steele to come up with the “Steele Dossier.” And come to find out the FBI had Steele on its payroll all the way up until almost the month of the election. Fusion GPS also employed Nellie Ohr,  whose husband, Bruce Ohr, just so happened to be Associate Deputy Attorney General in the Obama Administration and who had contacts with Steele.\\n\\nA FISA warrant was attained for Carter Page, who just so happened to be a member of The Council On Foreign Relations and who had actually worked with the FBI in the past. This FISA warrant employed the [“Three Hop Rule”](https://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/oct/28/nsa-files-decoded-hops) where the NSA and agencies can literally spy on anyone associated with Carter Page, which means anyone even lightly associated with him who is also within the campaign. Notice how Page still is free today.\\n\\nThere’s vastly more to it all but you get the idea. \\n\\nIt was clear entrapment and a setup but I don’t think anyone in the FBI and Clinton campaign thought Trump would win near the time of the election. They thought Clinton would win and all the illegal actions and spying would be swept under the rug. \\n\\nFlynn flipped because his son was threatened and he was gagged as a result. He was the domino they needed to start everything off. It just so happened that his number one bureaucratic enemy and the man who had fired him years before, James Clapper, was head of the largest intelligence agency in the US. Flynn’s phone call with the Russian ambassador which took place in December of 2016 was leaked to Washington Post reporter David Ignatius in early January of 2017, weeks before Trump took office. Why would then Flynn lie a month later, knowing full well given Ignatius’s article, that what he spoke to the ambassador about was likely recorded and documented? Who did he supposedly lie to? Andrew McCabe, Comey’s right hand man, and another unknown FBI agent. The same McCabe who just admitted this week to being a part of coup talks against a sitting president.\\n\\nI could go on and on....books will be written about all this one day. \\n\\nYou will hear propagandists use arguments like “The Trump campaign had over 100 contacts with Russians” and other McCarthy era style BS to cast aspersions upon the President. It isn’t illegal to speak to Russians. How many “contacts” did they have with Saudis and Israelis and Turks? “Contacts” isn’t an indictment of anything. You will then hear them point to those in the Trump campaign being caught in lies. Don’t we know by now to never speak with law enforcement alone and that they can legally lie and entrap you and use *anything* you may say against you? If you mention something happened on Tuesday and it turns out it was actually Wednesday and you forgot then that is considered a *lie* based on what their need is. You just “lied to the FBI.” \\n\\nTidbit: Former prosecutor Ken Starr, who went after the Clinton administration in the 1990s about Whitewater revealed in his recent book that none other then Rod Rosenstein was present during Hillary Clinton’s interview with prosecutors in the 1990s. The same Rod Rosenstein who wrote a letter detailing why James Comey should be fired and then after Comey was fired then wrote another letter giving Mueller powers of the Special Counsel.\\n\\nNow you have neoliberals turning to intelligence agencies and neocons and warmongers as bastions of truth because they have been brainwashed and propagandized enough to the point where they actually believe that Trump is akin to Hitler and is actually authoritarian when the actual authoritarians are those they are championing.'},\n",
